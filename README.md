# Implementation-of-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-SGD-Regressor

## AIM:
To write a program to implement Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor for linear regression and evaluate its performance.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
4. Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
5. Divide the data into training and testing sets.
6. Create an SGD Regressor model.
7. Fit the model on the training data.
8. Evaluate the model performance.
9. Make predictions and visualize the results.
## Program:
```

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'encoded_car_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select relevant features and target variable
X = df.drop(columns=['price'])  # All columns except 'price'
y = df['price']  # Target variable

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the SGD Regressor
sgd_model = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, random_state=42)  # Default settings
sgd_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions on test set
y_pred = sgd_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Model Performance:")
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R-squared:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Print model coefficients
print("\nModel Coefficients:")
print("Coefficients:", sgd_model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", sgd_model.intercept_)
```
